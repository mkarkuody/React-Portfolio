          <p>My name is <b>Merdad</b>. I am chasing my dreams. Moved from Iran, got my US citizenship, learned 4 more
            languages
            other than my mother tongue, and got my <b>MBA</b>. </p>
          <br/>
          <p>I am so motivated and done several projects for Canon (the company that make camera and printers) and
            helped my department to get silver medal in Canon world with presenting how to reduce mold change time from
            an hour to fifteen minutes. <em><b> we saved 2 million dollars yearly for Canon Inc.</b></em>

            As long as I know myself, I have loved to learn computer science. living in Seattle gives me an opportunity
            to Join UW full stack web development BootCamp and leads me to find a Job in Microsoft, Google or Facebook.
